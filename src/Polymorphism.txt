 Polymorphism: ability to take more than one form
Compile time polymorphism: also known as Static Polymorphism. In this compiler is aware of the functions with same name and also which 
overloaded function is to be called.
Run time polymorphism: dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overriden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile
time. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
